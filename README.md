# Country (de)stereotyper

We are rarely short of prejudice when it comes to countries' cultures. Some of them might be grounded in our encounters with foreigners, from our readings (social media??), or even sheer fantasy!!

The Country (de)stereotyper helps you **build stereotypes that are at least slightly backed-up by data**!

In its prototype version, it helps you identify questions from the [PEW Global Attitudes & Trends Survey](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/) where two countries or regions differ the most.
